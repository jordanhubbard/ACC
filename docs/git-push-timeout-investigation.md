# Git Push Failure Investigation — phase/milestone

## Incident 3 — DNS Resolution Failure (2026-04-25)

**Affected task:** `task-2126d2448912444c988863a30db5cf6a`
**Symptom:** Phase milestone commit failed with:

```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

### Root Cause

Same class of failure as Incident 2: the agent host lost DNS resolution for
`github.com` at the moment the milestone commit attempted to push.  The error
message `nodename nor servname provided, or not known` is the POSIX
`getaddrinfo()` return code for `EAI_NONAME` / `EAI_AGAIN`, indicating the DNS
resolver was unavailable or returned an error — not that GitHub itself was down
or that credentials are invalid.

Key evidence:
- The error text is identical to Incident 2, confirming a recurring pattern of
  transient DNS-resolution failures on this agent host rather than a permissions
  or credential issue.
- Prior phase/milestone commits continue to accumulate successfully, confirming
  the remote repository and SSH key are correctly configured and only momentary
  DNS outages are responsible for the failures.

### Status

The fixes documented under Incident 2 (DNS pre-flight check, push retry loop)
address this class of failure.  This incident confirms those mitigations should
be prioritised for deployment.  No additional code change is required beyond
what was specified in Incident 2.

## Incident 2 — DNS Resolution Failure (2026-04-25)

**Affected task:** `task-f7fa50cf1765488a8cc32bdf86772e9b`  
**Symptom:** Phase milestone commit failed with:

```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

### Root Cause

The agent host lost DNS resolution for `github.com` at the moment the milestone
commit tried to push.  This is a **transient network partition** (DNS resolver
unavailable, upstream resolver timeout, or `/etc/resolv.conf` misconfiguration)
rather than a persistent connectivity loss — the host can reach the internet but
cannot resolve hostnames momentarily.

Key evidence:
- Error message `nodename nor servname provided, or not known` is the POSIX
  `getaddrinfo()` return for `EAI_NONAME` / `EAI_AGAIN`, which indicates the DNS
  resolver returned an error or was unreachable, not that GitHub itself was down.
- The `phase/milestone` branch has accumulated many successful commits
  (`d54824c`, `bccacc7`, `bf957d4`, …) — confirming this is not a credential or
  permission issue.
- Local branch `phase/milestone` is at `d54824c0` which equals
  `refs/remotes/origin/phase/milestone` — meaning the most recent milestone
  commit was eventually pushed (or the remote tracking ref was updated), so the
  content is not lost.

### Fix Applied

1. **Pre-flight DNS check in `acc-repo-sync.sh`:** Added a `dns_preflight` step
   that resolves `github.com` (via `getent hosts` or `dig`) before attempting a
   fetch/push.  If DNS fails, the script logs a warning and exits with code `0`
   (non-fatal) so the systemd timer retries on the next cycle instead of
   accumulating error noise.

2. **Retry loop around the push step:** `acc-repo-sync.sh` now retries the push
   up to 3 times with a 10-second back-off, so a single-cycle DNS blip does not
   cause a permanent miss.

3. **`.git/config` tracking entry for `phase/milestone`:** Added an explicit
   `[branch "phase/milestone"]` section so `git push` can resolve the upstream
   without a fetch first (reduces the number of DNS calls needed per sync cycle).

## Incident 1 — SSH Timeout (2026-04-25)

**Affected task:** `task-770121149e5f414ea8940fec81d6c7bb`  
**Symptom:** `git push` timed out during phase milestone commit on branch `phase/milestone`

---

## Root Cause

The repository remote uses SSH (`git@github.com:/jordanhubbard/ACC.git`) with **no
timeout configuration** in `.git/config` or the global git config. When the SSH
handshake or data transfer stalls (transient GitHub connectivity blip, NAT
keepalive expiry, or momentary DNS hiccup), git waits indefinitely and the
milestone-commit process is eventually killed by the outer process watchdog.

Key evidence:
- `git config --list` shows no `http.lowSpeedLimit`, `http.lowSpeedTime`, or
  `core.sshCommand` entries — meaning git uses system defaults with no explicit
  timeout guard.
- The remote URL uses the `git@github.com:/…` SSH form (note the leading `/` after
  the colon, which is redundant but harmless on most SSH clients). The slash can
  cause a DNS-level extra lookup on some OpenSSH versions before it resolves to
  the correct GitHub endpoint; under degraded connectivity this adds latency.
- Multiple prior phase milestone commits (`55b701f`, `ae2f2bd`, `0c34006`, …) all
  show `0 tasks reviewed and approved`, meaning the branch accumulates commits
  normally — this is not a persistent failure, confirming the cause is transient.

---

## Fix Applied

Added SSH timeout configuration to `.git/config` (local repo scope) so future
pushes will fail fast rather than hang:

```
[core]
    sshCommand = ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3
```

This gives:
- **30 s** to complete the initial TCP/SSH handshake  
- **15 s** keepalive probes while the connection is open, with **3** retries before
  the client considers the server dead — meaning a stalled push will be aborted
  within ~45 s instead of hanging forever.

The remote URL also corrected to the canonical form (`github.com:jordanhubbard/ACC.git`
without the leading `/`) to eliminate the redundant path component.

---

## Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Retry push:** The milestone-commit cron will pick up the `phase/milestone`
   branch on its next cycle. With the timeout guard in place the retry should
   succeed or fail quickly.

2. **Global git config (optional):** Apply the same `sshCommand` setting to
   `~/.gitconfig` on each agent host so all repos benefit, not just this one.

3. **Monitor:** If timeouts recur more than once per week, investigate whether
   the agent host is behind an aggressive NAT or firewall that drops idle TCP
   connections before the SSH handshake completes; increasing `ServerAliveInterval`
   to `10` or switching to HTTPS with a token would be the next step.

4. **DNS health:** If DNS resolution failures recur, check `/etc/resolv.conf` and
   consider adding `8.8.8.8` as a fallback resolver, or switching the agent host
   to use systemd-resolved with a local cache so transient upstream failures do
   not prevent hostname lookups.
